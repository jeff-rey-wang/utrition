This section records information for easy reference.

\subsection{Table of Units}

Throughout this document SI (Syst\`{e}me International d'Unit\'{e}s) is employed
as the unit system.  In addition to the basic units, several derived units are
used as described below.  For each unit, the symbol is given followed by a
description of the unit and the SI name.
~\newline

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\begin{table}[ht]
  \noindent \begin{tabular}{l l l} 
    \toprule		
    \textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{SI}\\
    \midrule 
    \si{\metre} & length & metre\\
    \si{\kilogram} & mass	& kilogram\\
    \si{\second} & time & second\\
    \si{\celsius} & temperature & centigrade\\
    \si{\joule} & energy & joule\\
    \si{\watt} & power & watt (W = \si{\joule\per\second})\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  %	\caption{Provide a caption}
%\end{table}

\plt{Only include the units that your SRS actually uses.}

\plt{Derived units, like newtons, pascal, etc, should show their derivation
    (the units they are derived from) if their constituent units are in the
    table of units (that is, if the units they are derived from are used in the
    document).  For instance, the derivation of pascals as
    $\si{\pascal}=\si{\newton\per\square\meter}$ is shown if newtons and m are
    both in the table.  The derivations of newtons would not be shown if kg and
    s are not both in the table.}

\plt{The symbol for units named after people use capital letters, but the name
  of the unit itself uses lower case.  For instance, pascals use the symbol Pa,
  watts use the symbol W, teslas use the symbol T, newtons use the symbol N,
  etc.  The one exception to this is degree Celsius.  Details on writing metric
  units can be found on the 
  \href{https://www.nist.gov/pml/weights-and-measures/writing-metric-units}
  {NIST} web-page.}

\subsection{Table of Symbols}

The table that follows summarizes the symbols used in this document along with
their units.  The choice of symbols was made to be consistent with the heat
transfer literature and with existing documentation for solar water heating
systems.  The symbols are listed in alphabetical order.

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
%\noindent \begin{tabularx}{1.0\textwidth}{l l X}
\noindent \begin{longtable*}{l l p{12cm}} \toprule
\textbf{symbol} & \textbf{unit} & \textbf{description}\\
\midrule 
$A_C$ & \si[per-mode=symbol] {\square\metre} & coil surface area
\\
$A_\text{in}$ & \si[per-mode=symbol] {\square\metre} & surface area over 
which heat is transferred in
\\ 
\bottomrule
\end{longtable*}
\plt{Use your problems actual symbols.  The si package is a good idea to use for
  units.}

\subsection{Mathematical Notation}

\plt{This section is optional, but should be included for projects that make use
  of notation to convey mathematical information.  For instance, if typographic
  conventions (like bold face font) are used to distinguish matrices, this
  should be stated here.  If symbols are used to show mathematical operations,
  these should be summarized here.  In some cases the easiest way to summarize
  the notation is to point to a text or other source that explains the
  notation.}

\plt{This section was added to the template because some students use very
  domain specific notation.  This notation will not be readily understandable to
  people outside of your domain.  It should be explained.}

\newpage

\pagenumbering{arabic}

\plt{This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007}.  It
  will get you started.  You should not modify the section headings, without
  first discussing the change with the course instructor.  Modification means
  you are not following the template, which loses some of the advantage of a
  template, especially standardization.  Although the bits shown below do not
  include type information, you may need to add this information for your
  problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
  general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
expect in the Introduction section.}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document describes the requirements for 'Utrition'. It will provide a 
detailed overview of the application, and a comprehensive description of the 
software's functional, non-functional requirements, as well as other details 
relevant to the product. The template for this document is a modified version 
of the Volere template \citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.


\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
  mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
  section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
  purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
  etc.}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 
When considering the files the user uploads to the system, the requirements of 
this document are constrained to consider only a subset of all possible file 
types. Furthermore, requirements are created under the impression that files 
are of a manageable size. Lastly, we assume the user accesses the system 
through a computer capable of running most modern applications. That is to say, 
the user possesses sufficient hardware capabilities to run the system.

\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
  properties, etc.}  

\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
This document is intended for the developers and testers working on this 
system, so that the requirements of the system can be communicated throughout 
the development process. Readers should have an understanding of the software 
design life cycle as well as the ability to read discrete math at a 
university-level or better in order to fully understand the contents and 
equations used in this document.

\plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
  SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
  section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
  people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
  will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
  requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
  software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
  the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}

\plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
  as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
  understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
  instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
  graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}

The rest of the SRS will discuss the purpose and context of the system, 
followed by the functional requirements it must satisfy. Then the document will 
mention its non-functional requirements, providing justifications for each. 
This is followed by a discussion of potential issues that may arise during the 
project's development. Lastly, the document lists likely and unlikely 
changes, and includes a traceability matrix for the system.

\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
  be similar between project.}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  \plt{This text can likely be
  borrowed verbatim.}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilites should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

\plt{This section summarizes the knowledge/skills expected of the user.
  Measuring usability, which is often a required non-function requirement,
  requires knowledge of a typical user.  As mentioned above, the user is a
  different role from the ``intended reader,'' as given in
  Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}.  As in Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}, the
  user characteristics should be specific an unambiguous.  For instance, ``The
  end user of \progname{} should have an understanding of undergraduate Level 1
  Calculus and Physics.''}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

\section{Specific System Description}

This section first presents the problem description, which gives a high-level
view of the problem to be solved.  This is followed by the solution characteristics
specification, which presents the assumptions, theories, definitions and finally
the instance models.  \plt{Add any project specific details that are relevant
  for the section overview.}

\subsection{Problem Description} \label{Sec_pd}

\progname{} is intended to solve ... \plt{What problem does your program solve?
The description here should be in the problem space, not the solution space.}

\subsubsection{Terminology and  Definitions}

\plt{This section is expressed in words, not with equations.  It provide the
  meaning of the different words and phrases used in the domain of the problem.
The terminology is used to introduce concepts from the world outside of the
mathematical model  The terminology provides a real world connection to give the
mathematical model meaning.}

This subsection provides a list of terms that are used in the subsequent
sections and their meaning, with the purpose of reducing ambiguity and making it
easier to correctly understand the requirements:

\begin{itemize}

\item 

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Physical System Description} \label{sec_phySystDescrip}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
  physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
  logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
  studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
  description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
  independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
  include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
  shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
  interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
  include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
  interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
  interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure~?,
includes the following elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1:] 

\item[PS2:] ...

\end{itemize}

\plt{A figure here makes sense for most SRS documents}

% \begin{figure}[h!]
% \begin{center}
% %\rotatebox{-90}
% {
%  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{<FigureName>}
% }
% \caption{\label{<Label>} <Caption>}
% \end{center}
% \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Goal Statements}

\plt{The goal statements refine the ``Problem Description''
  (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  A goal is a functional objective the system under
  consideration should achieve. Goals provide criteria for sufficient
  completeness of a requirements specification and for requirements
  pertinence. Goals will be refined in Section “Instanced Models”
  (Section~\ref{sec_instance}). Large and complex goals should be decomposed
  into smaller sub-goals.  The goals are written abstractly, with a minimal
  amount of technical language.  They should be understandable by non-domain
  experts.}

\noindent Given the \plt{inputs}, the goal statements are:

\begin{itemize}

\item[GS\refstepcounter{goalnum}\thegoalnum \label{G_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{One
    sentence description of the goal.  There may be more than one.  Each Goal
    should have a meaningful label.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Solution Characteristics Specification}

\plt{This section specifies the information in the solution domain of the system
  to be developed. This section is intended to express what is required in
  such a way that analysts and stakeholders get a clear picture, and the
  latter will accept it. The purpose of this section is to reduce the problem
  into one expressed in mathematical terms. Mathematical expertise is used to
  extract the essentials from the underlying physical description of the
  problem, and to collect and substantiate all physical data pertinent to the
  problem.}

\plt{This section presents the solution characteristics by successively refining
  models.  It starts with the abstract/general Theoretical Models (TMs) and
  refines them to the concrete/specific Instance Models (IMs).  If necessary
  there are intermediate refinements to General Definitions (GDs).  All of these
  refinements can potentially use Assumptions (A) and Data Definitions (DD).
  TMs are refined to create new models, that are called GMs or IMs. DDs are not
  refined; they are just used. GDs and IMs are derived, or refined, from other
  models. DDs are not derived; they are just given. TMs are also just given, but
  they are refined, not used.  If a potential DD includes a derivation, then
  that means it is refining other models, which would make it a GD or an IM.}

\plt{The above makes a distinction between ``refined'' and ``used.'' A model is
  refined to another model if it is changed by the refinement. When we change a
  general 3D equation to a 2D equation, we are making a refinement, by applying
  the assumption that the third dimension does not matter. If we use a
  definition, like the definition of density, we aren't refining, or changing
  that definition, we are just using it.}

\plt{The same information can be a TM in one problem and a DD in another.  It is
  about how the information is used.  In one problem the definition of
  acceleration can be a TM, in another it would be a DD.}

\plt{There is repetition between the information given in the different chunks
  (TM, GDs etc) with other information in the document.  For instance, the
  meaning of the symbols, the units etc are repeated.  This is so that the
  chunks can stand on their own when being read by a reviewer/user.  It also
  facilitates reuse of the models in a different context.}

\noindent \plt{The relationships between the parts of the document are show in
  the following figure.  In this diagram ``may ref'' has the same role as
  ``uses'' above.  The figure adds ``Likely Changes,'' which are able to
  reference (use) Assumptions.}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics[scale=0.9]{RelationsBetweenTM_GD_IM_DD_A.pdf}
\end{figure}

The instance models that govern \progname{} are presented in
Subsection~\ref{sec_instance}.  The information to understand the meaning of the
instance models and their derivation is also presented, so that the instance
models can be verified.

\subsubsection{Assumptions} \label{sec_assumpt}

\plt{The assumptions are a refinement of the scope.  The scope is general, where
  the assumptions are specific.  All assumptions should be listed, even those
  that domain experts know so well that they are rarely (if ever) written down.}
\plt{The document should not take for granted that the reader knows which
  assumptions have been made. In the case of unusual assumptions, it is
  recommended that the documentation either include, or point to, an explanation
  and justification for the assumption.}

This section simplifies the original problem and helps in developing the
theoretical model by filling in the missing information for the physical
system. The numbers given in the square brackets refer to the theoretical model
[T], general definition [GD], data definition [DD], instance model [IM], or
likely change [LC], in which the respective assumption is used.

\begin{itemize}

\item[A\refstepcounter{assumpnum}\theassumpnum \label{A_meaningfulLabel}:]
  \plt{Short description of each assumption.  Each assumption
    should have a meaningful label.  Use cross-references to identify the
    appropriate traceability to T, GD, DD etc., using commands like dref, ddref
    etc.  Each assumption should be atomic - that is, there should not be an
    explicit (or implicit) ``and'' in the text of an assumption.}

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Theoretical Models}\label{sec_theoretical}

\plt{Theoretical models are sets of abstract mathematical equations or axioms
  for solving the problem described in Section ``Physical System Description''
  (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}). Examples of theoretical models are
  physical laws, constitutive equations, relevant conversion factors, etc.}

This section focuses on the general equations and laws that \progname{} is based
on.  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and add additional models
  as appropriate.}

\plt{``Ref.\ By'' is used repeatedly with the different types of information.
  This stands for Referenced By.  It means that the models, definitions and

  opposite direction to what we commonly do.  You still need to have a reference
  in the other direction pointing to the current model, definition or
  assumption.  As an example, if T1 is referenced by G2, that means that G2 will
  explicitly include a reference to T1.}

\subsubsection{General Definitions}\label{sec_gendef}

\plt{General Definitions (GDs) are a refinement of one or more TMs, and/or of
  other GDs.  The GDs are less abstract than the TMs.  Generally the reduction
  in abstraction is possible through invoking (using/referencing) Assumptions.
  For instance, the TM could be Newton's Law of Cooling stated abstracting.  The
  GD could take the general law and apply it to get a 1D equation.}

This section collects the laws and equations that will be used in building the
instance models.

\plt{Some projects may not have any content for this section, but the section
  heading should be kept.}  \plt{Modify the examples below for your problem, and
  add additional definitions as appropriate.}

\plt{This may be necessary when the necessary information does not fit in the
  description field.}
\plt{Derivations are important for justifying a given GD.  You want it to be
  clear where the equation came from.}

\subsubsection{Data Definitions}\label{sec_datadef}

\plt{The Data Definitions are definitions of symbols and equations that are
  given for the problem.  They are not derived; they are simply used by other
  models.  For instance, if a problem depends on density, there may be a data
  definition for the equation defining density.  The DDs are given information
  that you can use in your other modules.}

\plt{All Data Definitions should be used (referenced) by at least one other
  model.}

This section collects and defines all the data needed to build the instance
models. The dimension of each quantity is also given.  \plt{Modify the examples
  below for your problem, and add additional definitions as appropriate.}

  Description & 
                $T_C$ is the temperature of the coil (\si{\celsius}).  $T_W$ is the temperature of the water (\si{\celsius}).  
                The heat flux out of the coil, $q_C$ (\si{\watt\per\square\metre}), is found by
                assuming that Newton's Law 
                of Cooling applies (\aref{A_Newt_coil}).  This law (\dref{NL}) is used on the surface of
                the coil, which has area $A_C$ (\si{\square\metre}) and heat 
                transfer coefficient $h_C$
                (\si{\watt\per\square\metre\per\celsius}).  This equation
                assumes that the temperature of the coil is constant over time (\aref{A_tcoil}) and that it does not vary along the length
                of the coil (\aref{A_tlcoil}).

\subsubsection{Data Types}\label{sec_datatypes}

\plt{This section is optional.  In many scientific computing programs it isn't
  necessary, since the inputs and outpus are straightforward types, like reals,
  integers, and sequences of reals and integers.  However, for some problems it
  is very helpful to capture the type information.}

\plt{The data types are not derived; they are simply stated and used by other
  models.}

\plt{All data types must be used by at least one of the models.}

\plt{For the mathematical notation for expressing types, the recommendation is
  to use the notation of~\citet{HoffmanAndStrooper1995}.}

\subsubsection{Instance Models} \label{sec_instance}    

\plt{The motivation for this section is to reduce the problem defined in
  ``Physical System Description'' (Section~\ref{sec_phySystDescrip}) to one
  expressed in mathematical terms. The IMs are built by refining the TMs and/or
  GDs.  This section should remain abstract.  The SRS should specify the
  requirements without considering the implementation.}

This section transforms the problem defined in Section~\ref{Sec_pd} into 
one which is expressed in mathematical terms. It uses concrete symbols defined 
in Section~\ref{sec_datadef} to replace the abstract symbols in the models 
identified in Sections~\ref{sec_theoretical} and~\ref{sec_gendef}.

  where the derivation cannot be described under the Description field, it will
  be necessary to include this subsection.}

\subsubsection{Input Data Constraints} \label{sec_DataConstraints}    

Table~\ref{TblInputVar} shows the data constraints on the input output
variables.  The column for physical constraints gives the physical limitations
on the range of values that can be taken by the variable.  The column for
software constraints restricts the range of inputs to reasonable values.  The
software constraints will be helpful in the design stage for picking suitable
algorithms.  The constraints are conservative, to give the user of the model the
flexibility to experiment with unusual situations.  The column of typical values
is intended to provide a feel for a common scenario.  The uncertainty column
provides an estimate of the confidence with which the physical quantities can be
measured.  This information would be part of the input if one were performing an
uncertainty quantification exercise.

The specification parameters in Table~\ref{TblInputVar} are listed in
Table~\ref{TblSpecParams}.

\section{Project Drivers }

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of the Utrition application is to help individuals learn more about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and assisting them in making wise decisions. This application is built for the users to learn more about what their meals consist of by breaking down the calories and nutrition facts of the food they intend on eating or purchasing.  

\subsection{The Stakeholders }
 
3.2.1 The Client –  

The client requesting this application is the instructor of the Software Engineering 4G06 classes Dr. Smith and the teaching assistants. This application is expected to be unique as compared to products in the market that attempt to tackle a similar problem as per the client's request.  

3.2.2 The Customers -  

The customers of Utrition are assumed to be health conscious individuals that are attempting to improve their daily eating habits. 

3.2.3 Other Stakeholders – Other stakeholders of the Utrition application consist of Grocery Stores, restaurants and gyms. These stakeholders are affected as the users of this program may switch their previous dynamic with these stakeholders due to their increase in knowledge of how many calories they are consuming. These dynamic changes consist of attending the gym more often to burn off extra calories, a preference to cook from home so restaurants may expect a decrease in customers and lastly Grocery stores stock may be affected due to an increase in knowledge of nutritional facts. 

\subsection{Mandated Constraints} 

As we wish to make the artificial intelligence as accurate as possible the application will only be trained for individual food items or ingredients rather than whole meals. For example, the user is expected to provide a picture of lettuce rather than a sandwich. This constraint is to ensure that the user gets an accurate estimate of exactly the nutritional value of their meal as the AI may not detect all separate food items in one picture. 

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions } 


We are assuming that the client will only take a picture of individual ingredients. The client is also expected to have knowledge of the metric system as Utrition will be outputting nutritional value data in Calories.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Below are open issues concerning the development of Utrition:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Depending on the amount of identified food image data our team can obtain, the accuracy of our food detection machine learning model may be low
	\item Currently, Utrition is planned to saved past user input. It is unknown how this will be done. Employing an account and password system for each user is added functionality that may be difficult to implement 
	\item One requirement states that past nutritional values of food will be stored for easy access when the system needs it again. When saving large amounts of nutritional data, processing could become slow for the entire system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
After investigating the market, there are two ready-made solutions that provide similar functionality to Utrition. Firstly, the application \href{https://www.caloriemama.ai/#Categories}{Calorie Mama} is able to identify calories when a picture is uploaded of the user's meal. Although this implements some of Utrition's functionality, it fails to identify nutritional information or save any past calorie calculations.

Another product the team found to be similar to Utrition is \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.bite.biteapp&hl=en_US&gl=US}{Bitesnap}. This application will be able to identify food items, provide their corresponding nutritional information and calories, and store this information to provide eating insights for the user. Frequent reviews state that the system is not able to identify many foods provided in an image by the user. This means that the application's food database is small. Utrition will focus on creating a machine learning model that is able to identify a vast number of food items by supplying a large dataset of labelled food images. 

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
Through research into libraries and APIs, the team has identified two systems that can be used for development of Utrition. Firstly, our team plans to create a machine learning model to identify different food items from an uploaded image. To do this the \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{TensorFlow} library can be used. This free and open-source library will all use to create and employ our machine learning model.

Secondly, Utrition must be able to return nutritional information about a food when an image of that food is uploaded. In order to retrieve this nutritional information, calls to \href{https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api}{Nutritionix API} can be made. Nutritionix contains data on a vast range of foods and their nutritional value. Using the free version, our team can make calls to this API to retrieve needed nutritional information.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
The team will be using datasets of labelled food images in order to train our machine learning model. These datasets can be freely obtained online and used in our development.

\subsection{New Problems}
N.A.

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
Team members will follow a strict schedule to ensure the completion of Utrition. The team will work in 1 week Sprint cycles where tasks are distributed during the first meeting of the week (Monday at 6:30pm) and all tasks must be finished before that meeting the week after. There is also a scheduled progress meeting half-way through the Sprint (Thursday at 1:30pm) to give an update to the team on each person's progress and discuss any blocking issues. The team will create tasks each week based on the due dates provided in SFWRENG 4G06. This ensures that all deadlines are met.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N.A.

\subsection{Risks}
\subsubsection{Low Productivity}
Working on a team with multiple developers creates the possibility that some people will not be productive and complete their assigned tasks. Missed work will cause a higher risk for an incomplete or inadequate final implementation. This risk can be identified when a developer is frequently missing deadlines and delivering poorly done work. To address this risk, the offending team member will be addressed directly by the group and asked about their opinion on possible solutions. This can include working on different areas of the project, asking for help when needed, etc.\newline
\textbf{Probability:} \%15

\subsubsection{Inadequate Implementation}
Due to the volume of requirements, the difficulty of the implementation, and the timeline of the project, there is a risk that the development team will not be able to create a good quality product. This includes partial implementation of features or hardcoded work arounds. To identify this risk before it becomes an issue, the development team hosts weekly progress meetings to ensure all members are proceeding smoothly. In the event that this risk is unavoidable, the team will alter the final goals of Utrition to remove unnecessary functionality.\newline
\textbf{Probability:} \%10

\subsubsection{Limited Time Frame}
Since Utrition's final implementation and documentation are required in less than 7 months, there is a risk that the project does not get completed. Every team member has additional work responsibilities outside of this project which could affect the time they have to work on Utrition. One sign that this risk poses a threat to the project is missed deadlines. This sign can be identified easily during the team's weekly meetings. If this risk becomes a problem, the team will apply an all-hands-on-deck approach where all unfinished work will be split up equally.\newline
\textbf{Probability:} \%8

\subsection{Costs}
Utrition will be development using free programming technologies and open-source libraries. This sets the current budget of the project to \$0. The plan for Utrition's availability is for users to download all code files from GitHub in order to run the system. In future development, hosting Utrition as a website will cost between the range of \$3.95 - \$16.95 per month.

The time cost for the project is calculated based on the number of developers and the duration of the project. Utrition will be development by 6 individuals who all can provide 10 hours every week. The duration of the project is set to 8 months. Using these values, the total amount of time needed to complete the project is 1920 hours and 320 hours per developer.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
Utrition will be available to users from GitHub. Inside the repository, the README file will contain instructions for the download and setup of Utrition. Any required software needed by the user to run Utrition will be specified in this file along with solutions to common installation errors. This file will also discuss all functionality of the system and provide instructions for the user to use Utrition. This section will act as the user manual. 

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
There is no training needed for users to use Utrition. Any questions regarding usage of the system will be available in the user manual.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
In this section, requirements for future releases of Utrition are stated from highest to lowest priority. For a more in-depth explanation of each requirement, please refer to section 3 (Stretch Goals) inside the Problem Statement and Goals document.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [\FillFRNumber] The system must be accessible online as a website.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} Hosting Utrition online will make it easier for users to access the system. They can search for Utrition in an online search instead of downloading the project from GitHub.
	
	\item [\FillFRNumber] The system must be able to identify the individual foods inside a picture of a meal.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} If the system can identify visually apparent ingredients inside of a meal, the user will not need to upload pictures of each individual food item which will increase efficiency.
	
	\item [\FillFRNumber] Users must be able to save preset meal options consisting of one or many foods.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} Users can save selected foods together as meals so they can easily log this meal as eaten without needing to manually upload images of individual ingredients.
	
	\item [\FillFRNumber] Utrition will provide insights into the eating habits of the user such as what vitamins they should try to consume more of based on their previous inputs.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} By providing health insights, the system will become more useful to users by helping them improve their eating habits rather than solely tracking them.
	
	\item [NF?.] Once hosted online, Utrition must compute output with similar performance to the downloaded system within a 25\% margin of error.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} Hosting Utrition online should provide similar performance speeds compared to the local version so users experience the same enjoyment levels when using the system.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

Below are some ideas for implementation of Utrition:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create frontend display using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to connect to backend
	\item Backend can be implemented with Python
	\item Use \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{TensorFlow} library to create a machine learning model and train it with datasets of labelled food
	\item Use \href{https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api}{Nutritionix API} calls to retrieve nutrition facts of food items
\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}    
\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{Give
    the likely changes, with a reference to the related assumption (aref), as appropriate.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}    

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}:] \plt{Give
    the unlikely changes.  The design can assume that the changes listed will
    not occur.}

\end{itemize}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

\section{Development Plan}

\plt{This section is optional.  It is used to explain the plan for developing
  the software.  In particular, this section gives a list of the order in which
  the requirements will be implemented.  In the context of a course  this is
  where you can indicate which requirements will be implemented as part of the
  course, and which will be ``faked'' as future work.  This section can be
  organized as a prioritized list of requirements, or it could should the
  requirements that will be implemented for ``phase 1'', ``phase 2'', etc.}

\section{Values of Auxiliary Constants}

\plt{Show the values of the symbolic parameters introduced in the report.}

\plt{The definition of the requirements will likely call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.}

\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
