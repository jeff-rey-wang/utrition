\plt{This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007}.  It
  will get you started.  You should not modify the section headings, without
  first discussing the change with the course instructor.  Modification means
  you are not following the template, which loses some of the advantage of a
  template, especially standardization.  Although the bits shown below do not
  include type information, you may need to add this information for your
  problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
  general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
expect in the Introduction section.}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

This document describes the requirements for 'Utrition'. It will provide a 
detailed overview of the application, and a comprehensive description of the 
software's functional and non-functional requirements, as well as other details 
relevant to the product. The template for this document is a modified version 
of the Volere template \citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.


\plt{This section summarizes the purpose of the SRS document.  It does not focus
  on the problem itself.  The problem is described in the ``Problem
  Description'' section (Section~\ref{Sec_pd}).  The purpose is for the document
  in the context of the project itself, not in the context of this course.
  Although the ``purpose'' of the document is to get a grade, you should not
  mention this.  Instead, ``fake it'' as if this is a real project.  The purpose
  section will be similar between projects.  The purpose of the document is the
  purpose of the SRS, including communication, planning for the design stage,
  etc.}

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 
When considering the files the user uploads to the system, the requirements of 
this document are constrained to consider only a subset of all possible file 
types. Furthermore, requirements are created under the impression that files 
are of a manageable size, and are of food objects identifiable by a machine 
learning model. Lastly, we assume the user possesses sufficient knowledge to 
access the system, and does so with internet through a machine capable of 
running most modern applications. That is to say, the user possesses sufficient 
hardware capabilities to access all capabilities of the system.

\plt{Modelling the real world requires simplification.  The full complexity of
  the actual physics, chemistry, biology is too much for existing models, and
  for existing computational solution techniques.  Rather than say what is in
  the scope, it is usually easier to say what is not.  You can think of it as
  the scope is initially everything, and then it is constrained to create the
  actual scope.  For instance, the problem can be restricted to 2 dimensions, or
  it can ignore the effect of temperature (or pressure) on the material
  properties, etc.}  

\plt{The scope section is related to the assumptions section
  (Section~\ref{sec_assumpt}).  However, the scope and the assumptions are not
  at the same level of abstraction.  The scope is at a high level.  The focus is
  on the ``big picture'' assumptions.  The assumptions section lists, and
  describes, all of the assumptions.}

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
This document is intended for the developers and testers working on this 
system, so that the requirements of the system can be communicated throughout 
the development process. Readers should have an understanding of the software 
design life cycle as well as the ability to read discrete math at a 
university-level in order to fully understand the contents and 
equations used in this document.

\plt{This section summarizes the skills and knowledge of the readers of the
  SRS.  It does NOT have the same purpose as the ``User Characteristics''
  section (Section~\ref{SecUserCharacteristics}).  The intended readers are the
  people that will read, review and maintain the SRS.  They are the people that
  will conceivably design the software that is intended to meet the
  requirements.  The user, on the other hand, is the person that uses the
  software that is built.  They may never read this SRS document.  Of course,
  the same person could be a ``user'' and an ``intended reader.''}

\plt{The intended reader characteristics should be written as unambiguously and
  as specifically as possible.  Rather than say, the user should have an
  understanding of physics, say what kind of physics and at what level.  For
  instance, is high school physics adequate, or should the reader have had a
  graduate course on advanced quantum mechanics?}

\subsection{Organization of Document}

The rest of the SRS will discuss the purpose and context of the system, 
followed by the functional requirements it must satisfy. Then the document will 
mention its non-functional requirements, providing justifications for each. 
This is followed by a discussion of potential issues that may arise during the 
project's development. Lastly, the document lists likely and unlikely 
changes, and includes a traceability matrix for the system.

\plt{This section provides a roadmap of the SRS document.  It will help the
  reader orient themselves.  It will provide direction that will help them
  select which sections they want to read, and in what order.  This section will
  be similar between project.}

\section{Project Drivers }

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of the Utrition application is to help individuals learn more about maintaining a healthy lifestyle and assisting them in making wise decisions. This application is built for the users to learn more about what their meals consist of by breaking down the calories and nutrition facts of the food they intend on eating or purchasing.  

\subsection{The Stakeholders }

\subsubsection{The Client}  

The client requesting this application is the instructor of the Software Engineering 4G06, Dr. Smith and the teaching assistants. This application is expected to be unique as compared to products in the market that attempt to tackle a similar problem as per the client's request.  

\subsubsection{The Customers} 

The customers of Utrition are assumed to be health-conscious individuals that are attempting to improve their daily eating habits by tracking the nutrients and calories found in their previous meals. 

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders of the Utrition application consist of grocery stores, restaurants, and gyms. These stakeholders are affected as the users of this program may change their previous dynamic with these stakeholders due to their increase in knowledge of the nutrients they are consuming. In terms of a grocery store, their stock may be affected due to an increase in individuals buying more health-conscious foods. For restaurants, they might experience a decrease in customers if users develop a preference to cook from home in order to eat healthier. Lastly, gyms might see an increase in attendees if Utrition users wish to burn off extra calories they discover they have consumed.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints} 

As we wish to make Utrition as accurate as possible when identifying food, the application will only be trained for individual food items or ingredients rather than whole meals. For example, the user is expected to provide a picture of lettuce rather than an entire sandwich if they wish to track that lettuce appeared in their sandwich. This constraint is to ensure that the user gets an accurate estimate of exactly the nutritional value of their meal since the application may not detect all separate food items in one picture.

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions } 

\begin{itemize}
	
	\item [A1:] The user has an understanding of how to effectively utilize web based applications.
	
	\item [A2:] The user is able to upload a food image to Utrition. This can be a saved image or a new image taken using a device.
	
	\item [A3:] There is an assumption that the client will only take a picture of individual ingredients. 

	\item [A4:] The user is expected to have knowledge of the metric system as Utrition will be outputting nutritional value data in grams and calories.
	
	\item [A5.] The user is expected to have internet access while using Utrition.

\end{itemize}

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

The scope of the project is to develop a nutrition tracking application to identify food items based on an image and derive nutritional data from the classified food. This application can be installed on the user's system and will have comprehensive software documentation.

\section{Project Issues}

\subsection{Open Issues}
Below are open issues concerning the development of Utrition:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Depending on the amount of identified food image data our team can obtain, the accuracy of our food detection machine learning model may be low
	\item Currently, Utrition is planned to saved past user input locally. It is unknown how this will be done. One method such as employing an account and password system for each user is added functionality that may be difficult to implement 
	\item When saving large amounts of nutritional data to the database, processing could become slow for the entire system.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
After investigating the market, there are two ready-made solutions that provide similar functionality to Utrition. Firstly, the application \href{https://www.caloriemama.ai/#Categories}{Calorie Mama} is able to identify calories when a picture is uploaded of the user's meal. Although this implements some of Utrition's functionality, it fails to identify nutritional information or save any past calorie calculations.

Another product the team found to be similar to Utrition is \href{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.bite.biteapp&hl=en_US&gl=US}{Bitesnap}. This application will be able to identify food items, provide their corresponding nutritional information and calories, and store this information to provide eating insights for the user. Frequent reviews state that the system is not able to identify many foods provided in an image by the user. This means that the application's food database is small. Utrition will focus on creating a machine learning model that is able to identify a vast number of food items by supplying a large dataset of labelled food images. 

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
Through research into libraries and APIs, the team has identified two systems that can be used for development of Utrition. Firstly, our team plans to create a machine learning model to identify different food items from an uploaded image. To do this, the \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{TensorFlow} library can be used. This free and open-source library will be used to create and employ our machine learning model.

Secondly, Utrition must be able to return nutritional information about a food when an image of that food is uploaded. In order to retrieve this nutritional information, calls to \href{https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api}{Nutritionix API} can be made. Nutritionix contains data on a vast range of foods and their nutritional value. Using the free version, our team can make calls to this API to retrieve needed nutritional information.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
The team will be using datasets of labelled food images in order to train our machine learning model. These datasets can be freely obtained online and used in our development.

\subsection{New Problems}
N/A

\subsection{Tasks}
\subsubsection{Project Planning}
Team members will follow a strict schedule to ensure the completion of Utrition. The team will work in 1 week Sprint cycles where tasks are distributed during the first meeting of the week (Monday at 6:30pm) and all tasks must be finished before that meeting the week after. There is also a scheduled progress meeting half-way through the Sprint (Thursday at 1:30pm) to give an update to the team on each person's progress and discuss any blocking issues. The team will create tasks each week based on the due dates provided in SFWRENG 4G06. This ensures that all deadlines are met.

\subsection{Migration to the New Product}
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
\subsubsection{Low Productivity}
Working on a team with multiple developers creates the possibility that some people will not be productive and complete their assigned tasks. Missed work will cause a higher risk for an incomplete or inadequate final implementation. This risk can be identified when a developer is frequently missing deadlines and delivering poorly done work. To address this risk, the offending team member will be addressed directly by the group and asked about their opinion on possible solutions. This can include working on different areas of the project, asking for help when needed, etc.\newline
\textbf{Probability:} \%15

\subsubsection{Inadequate Implementation}
Due to the volume of requirements, the difficulty of the implementation, and the timeline of the project, there is a risk that the development team will not be able to create a good quality product. This includes partial implementation of features or hardcoded workarounds. To identify this risk before it becomes an issue, the development team hosts weekly progress meetings to ensure all members are proceeding smoothly. In the event that this risk is unavoidable, the team will alter the final goals of Utrition to remove unnecessary functionality.\newline
\textbf{Probability:} \%10

\subsubsection{Limited Time Frame}
Since Utrition's final implementation and documentation are required in less than 7 months, there is a risk that the project does not get completed. Every team member has additional work responsibilities outside of this project which could affect the time they have to work on Utrition. One sign that this risk poses a threat to the project is missed deadlines. This sign can be identified easily during the team's weekly meetings. If this risk becomes a problem, the team will apply an all-hands-on-deck approach where all unfinished work will be split up equally.\newline
\textbf{Probability:} \%8

\subsection{Costs}
Utrition will be development using free programming technologies and open-source libraries. This sets the current budget of the project to \$0. The plan for Utrition's availability is for users to download all code files from GitHub in order to run the system. In future development, hosting Utrition as a website will cost between the range of \$3.95 - \$16.95 per month.

The time cost for the project is calculated based on the number of developers and the duration of the project. Utrition will be development by 6 individuals who all can provide 10 hours every week. The duration of the project is set to 8 months. Using these values, the total amount of time needed to complete the project is 1920 hours and 320 hours per developer.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
\subsubsection{User Documentation Requirements}
Utrition will be available to users from GitHub. Inside the repository, the README file will contain instructions for the download and setup of Utrition. Any required software needed by the user to run Utrition will be specified in this file along with solutions to common installation errors. This file will also discuss all functionality of the system and provide instructions for the user to use Utrition. This section will act as the installation guide and user manual. 

\subsubsection{Training Requirements}
There is no training needed for users to use Utrition. Any questions regarding usage of the system will be available in the user manual.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
In this section, requirements for future releases of Utrition are stated from highest to lowest priority. For a more in-depth explanation of each requirement, please refer to section 3 (Stretch Goals) inside the \href{https://github.com/jeff-rey-wang/utrition/blob/main/docs/ProblemStatementAndGoals/ProblemStatement.pdf}{Problem Statement and Goals}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item [\FillFRNumber] The system must be accessible online as a website.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} Hosting Utrition online will make it easier for users to access the system. They can search for Utrition in an online search instead of downloading the project from GitHub.
	
	\item [\FillFRNumber] The system must be able to identify the individual foods inside a picture of a meal.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} If the system can identify visually apparent ingredients inside of a meal, the user will not need to upload pictures of each individual food item which will increase efficiency.
	
	\item [\FillFRNumber] Users must be able to save preset meal options consisting of one or many foods.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} Users can save selected foods together as meals so they can easily log this meal as eaten without needing to manually upload images of individual ingredients.
	
	\item [\FillFRNumber] Utrition will provide insights into the eating habits of the user such as what vitamins they should try to consume more of based on their previous inputs.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} By providing health insights, the system will become more useful to users by helping them improve their eating habits rather than solely tracking them.
	
	\item [\textbf{PR10.}] Once hosted online, Utrition must compute output with similar performance to the downloaded system within a 25\% margin of error.\newline
	\textbf{Rationale:} Hosting Utrition online should provide similar performance speeds compared to the local version so users experience the same enjoyment levels when using the system.
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}

Below are some ideas for implementation of Utrition:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Create frontend display using HTML/CSS and JavaScript to connect to backend
	\item Backend can be implemented with Python
	\item Use \href{https://www.tensorflow.org/}{TensorFlow} library to create a machine learning model and train it with datasets of labelled food
	\item Use \href{https://www.nutritionix.com/business/api}{Nutritionix API} calls to retrieve nutrition facts of food items
\end{itemize}

\section{Likely Changes}   
This section has been added to the Volere template and details the likely changes to the system that can be made later on in development.

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[\textbf{LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}}:] 
The system currently assumes the uploaded pictures will 
show individual ingredients. In the future, a more sophisticated computer 
vision model can be added to differentiate individual ingredients from a meal.

\item[\textbf{LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}}:] 
The system currently supports a model where the user uploads images of food to 
be evaluated. In the future, the system may allow the user to record their 
meals in real time and identify nutritional facts instantaneously.

\item[\textbf{LC\refstepcounter{lcnum}\thelcnum\label{LC_meaningfulLabel}}:] 
The system is currently designed to run locally on the user's device. In the 
future, the system can be hosted online, and allow users to request nutritional 
data from system servers.

\end{itemize}

\section{Unlikely Changes}  
This section has been added to the Volere template and details the unlikely changes to the system during development.  

\noindent \begin{itemize}

\item[\textbf{ULC\refstepcounter{ulcnum}\theulcnum\label{ULC_meaningfulLabel}}:] 
The user's past nutritional history will always be stored locally on the user's 
device rather than on an online server. This will limit the number of requests in the event the system 
is hosted online. Furthermore, this allows the user to access their nutritional history 
offline.

\end{itemize}

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules

\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}

\item Use BibTeX
\item Use cross-referencing
\end{itemize}
\item Grammar and writing rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
\item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between physical and software constraints
\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not
  a restating of the requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem).
  If you have a table of output constraints, then these are properties of a
  correct solution.
\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
  requirement could be more abstract

\subsection{Skills}
\subsubsection{Competence in specialized engineering knowledge}
This skill describes one's knowledge on specialized engineering subjects in order to contribute to implementation, documentation, and the final presentation. Some examples of this knowledge include understanding each documents' purposes, the different software architectures to be used in implementation, and proper version control practices. This is highly important for the success of Utrition since all aspects of the project are technically advanced and could not be accomplished by individuals uneducated in software engineering. Ways for people to improve this skill include consulting notes from past courses taken, reviewing previous projects, and researching needed unknown areas of expertise.

\subsubsection{Successfully uses engineering tools}
In order to create a successful project, it is necessary to be able to successfully utilize engineering tools. There are various types of engineering tools that all accomplish different tasks. For example, GitHub ensures that a large group of developers are all able to work on one project at the same time which promotes efficiency. Another example is \LaTeX which formats every document professionally. Kanban boards ensure that everything gets done by the deadlines and lastly, coding linters keep project code formatted consistently. Approaches to learning these skills include reading documentation, asking more knowledgeable individuals for advice, and reading online discussion boards that answer questions on how to utilize the tool. 

\subsubsection{Effective project management}
Effective Project Management is a skill for planning and effectively managing a project’s time, resources, and scope. Also, to master the skill, one must be able to follow business practices when appropriate. In relation to Utrition, these business practices are using git branches and pull requests, showing up to the biweekly meetings, working together on Microsoft Teams, and using git issues to assign tasks. Durum Wheat Semolina decided on these business practices, as they are needed to be able to allocate resources in an effective manner to ensure that the project tasks are efficiently completed. To exercise this skill, one can use GitHub to distribute tasks and assign individuals to them, use the project Kanban board frequently, and participate in all group meetings.

\subsubsection{Develops models/prototypes; tests, evaluates, \& iterates as 
appropriate}
This skill describes the ability to not only make changes to a system through 
successive iterations, but also completing analysis and evaluations of the 
system at each iteration. These practices help detect faults during the 
development process, before they can manifest as bugs, and helps ensure changes 
to the system adhere to the requirements. For Utrition, this is significant as 
it will be built out iteratively. Repeated, small changes will be made and 
include a set of tests to ensure that our project is meeting requirements 
throughout the development process. This skill can be exercised by creating a 
process for automated unit testing, as well as encouraging all team members to thoroughly test new code changes. Furthermore, the team can complete root cause 
analysis when fixing bugs in order to better track potentially error-prone code.

\subsubsection{Evaluates engineering tools, identifies their limitations, and selects, adapts, or extends them appropriately}
This skill describes the ability to choose the most effective software tool for an application from a variety of options based off of intended use, tool limitations, software requirements, ease of use, and a variety of other factors. Choosing the most relevant tools for our project is the best way to ensure that our project is not inherently limited by its framework and that it is ultimately successful. Knowing tool limitations will also allow us to adapt our product to either work around them or guide our development to incorporate them in our design process. The skill can be improved through reading tool documentation, researching tool reviews, comparisons, and benchmarks, and performing our own tests and sample code executions to evaluate their performance. 

\subsubsection{Active contribution to the planning and execution of a team project}
This skill describes the ability to contribute to the team project as an active member of the group. In order for all teammates to be more aligned with project goals and a standard of high-quality work, the group as a whole should be involved in the planning and execution of the project and be aligned on common goals. This requires the members to be invested in the planning and execution of the various components of the project. Having team members actively contribute to the project will foster a supportive and productive team dynamic. This skill can be improved through engaging in team meetings, sharing opinions or suggestions with the team, and helping with GitHub project board organization.

\subsection{Teammate Specific Learning Approaches}
\subsubsection{Alexander Moica}
Alexander has had repeated previous experience working with a specific set of software tools but has rarely branched out to investigate and evaluate potential alternatives. In order to develop the skills necessary for the efficient evaluation of competing software tools (Section 10.1.5), Alexander will search for tool reviews, comparisons, and benchmarks. This method was chosen since this content is available in a variety of easily digestible formats - including visual representations, video reviews, and interactive comparison tables.

\subsubsection{Yasmine Jolly}
Yasmine recognizes that she often forgets to work iteratively and test/evaluate her work as she progresses (Section 10.1.4). She often saves this step to the end of her work and spends large amounts of time searching for mistakes. During this project, she will work to improve this skill by frequently running tests on her code to make sure there are no new regressions introduced. This method was chosen because it allows Yasmine to frequently think about edge cases in her code and create tests that will find such exceptions.

\subsubsection{Jeffrey Wang}
Jeffrey is familiar with the tools and programming languages frequently 
used in the academic setting, but needs to improve his self-directed learning 
ability. During the development of Utrition, there will be opportunities to 
handle new technology outside the scope of an academic setting that will 
require self-learning to understand (Section 10.1.1). Jeffrey will research 
unknown areas of expertise to quickly develop an understanding of the unknown 
area to a level adequate for this project. Furthermore, he will read the 
documentation of new technologies to better understand its capabilities. These 
methods were chosen as they best tackle learning about subjects outside the 
scope of an academic setting.

\subsubsection{Jack Theriault}
Jack has acknowledged that in the past, he has found it difficult to plan a project, taking into consideration its time, resources, and scope (Section 10.1.3). Often times, time is overestimated, resulting in some elements of the project remaining unfinished. In order for him to improve his project management skills, Jack will check the project Kanban board regularly so he knows what tasks need to be done and by what date.


\subsubsection{Catherine Chen}
Catherine expressed that she wanted to be more proactive in the planning and execution of the project (Section 10.1.6). She has previously struggled with being aware of what other members are working on. In order to develop her initiative and leadership skills, Catherine will lead project planning meetings. This includes spearheading team meetings for planning project deadlines, being aware of the allocation of tasks within the group, actively using GitHub issues, and project board organization. This method was chosen as it allows her to take more of a leadership role within the team where she can plan the allocation of tasks to team members, and she will gain a more holistic view on the project.

\subsubsection{Justina Srebrnjak}
Justina identifies that she has difficulty with understanding certain engineering tools such as \LaTeX, make, and certain programming languages such as JavaScript (Section 10.1.2). In order to better understand these tools and use them successfully, Justina will read any documentation available. She has chosen this method since she possesses a visual learning style and documentation is easily accessible online.
