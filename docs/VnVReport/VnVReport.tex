		Input: The sample data is logged to a CSV file and then a request to read the CSV file is made with the results of the request saved to the variable ``lines".
		
		Expected Results: The variable ``lines" will be of length 2. The value at the second index of the list will equal the sample data when converted from a list format to a JSON object format. 
		
		How The Test Was Performed: The sample data is sent to our CSV logger function to create an entry for the data as well as its header row detailing the keys of the key value JSON pairings. To account for this header row, after we read the CSV file line by line with the built-in Python function readlines(), we check that the length of the returning list is 2.
		
		\textbf{Actual Results}: The actual results matched up with the expected results.
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Nutritional Facts Display}
	\begin{enumerate}
		
        \item{Test Name: current-nutrition-1}
        
        Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automatic.
		
		Initial State: The system contains a generated JPEG image of red pixels with dimensions 128 x 128. The system contains a list of one object of mocked JSON data. The classification of the sample image and the food\_name of the mocked JSON data are set to the same value, linking the two pieces of data.
		
		Input: A nested function call is made to get\_nutrition\_data() with an argument interface.open() whose own argument is the generated image. The result of this call is saved to the variable 'result'.
		
		Expected Results: The variable ``result" will be a list of length 1. The value of ``result" will be equal to the mocked JSON data. The value of ``result" will successfully convert to JSON format without any errors. There is also exception handling for an UnpicklingError, an error that can occur on some computers that is unrelated to the scope of the test.
		
		How The Test Was Performed: This is the overall black box test of our image classification system. It tests the whole process of classifying an image and retrieving JSON nutrition data for that image classification. If the test returns a list of one item, it means that the image was successfully classified and that the classification was equal to the food\_name in the mocked JSON data.
		
		\textbf{Actual Results}: Test passed. The actual results matched up with the expected results.
		
		\item{Test Name: past-nutrition-text-read-data-2}
		
		Type: Functional, Dynamic, Automatic.
		
		Initial State: The system contains a list of four distinct object of sample JSON data.
		
		Input: The sample data is logged to a CSV file and then the read\_file() function is called with its result saved to the variable ``result".
		
		Expected Results: The variable ``result" will be of length 4.
		
		How The Test Was Performed: The sample data is sent to our CSV logger function to create entries for each data as well as an overall header row detailing the keys of the key value JSON pairings. Our read\_file() function then reads the CSV file, ignoring the header row, and returns a sorted list of data objects. Since the header row is ignored, we can check that the length of the list of data returned is exactly equal to the number of data points we had in our sample data.
		
		\textbf{Actual Results}: Test passed. The actual results matched up with the expected results.
		
		\item{Test Name: display-elements-1}

		\textbf{Actual Results}: Test passed. The actual results matched up with the expected results.
		
		\item{Test Name: correct-path-1}
		
		Type: Functional, Automatic.
		
		Initial State: Tester will start on home page.
		
		Input: Tester will click hyperlink to go to a different page.
		
		Expected Results: The tester will be taken to the new page specified in hyperlink.
		
		How The Test Was Performed: The tester will attempt to mock a user input event clicking onto the specified hyperlink area by rendering a mocked version of the home page. Upon clicking the hyperlink area of the profile page, the testing framework should reply with a rendered profile page.
		
		\textbf{Actual Results}: Test passed. The actual results matched up with the expected results.

	Apart from the more defined tests discussed above, additional usability testing was conducted on several participants to obtain feedback regarding Utrition's overall quality and user experience. A semi-structured interview was conducted on a total of 5 individuals of different genders and ethnicities to provide a wide range of opinions and suggestions. The interview process consisted of a brief explanation of the application, sample tasks for the participant to perform, and a series of questions. The raw notes from each interview can be found in Appendix A.
	
	Many useful insights were gathered from the interview results. When participants were asked to input multiple food entries, most opted for text or voice upload options. The majority of participants did not read the instructions but completed the task quickly and with ease. Common likes brought up by participants included the colour scheme and layout of the application, the ease of use regarding food entry upload, and the depth of information found on the profile page.
	
	In terms of common dislikes, many participants wanted to see units beside the nutritional data they were receiving, more error messages when something goes wrong, and to have meals grouped together based on input time when viewing the profile page. Additional features that individuals wish to see in feature revisions include BMI inputs from the user, goal setting, and a graph displaying past food input information. Greater explanation on implementation changes is discussed in section 7.2.

	\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	
	
	N/A
	
	\section{Unit Testing}
	
	For this project, the majority of testing for functional and nonfunctional requirements was conducted through manual testing. The developers conducted manual tests to measure how the system reacted to possible scenarios and interactions. The automated unit testing of specific core functions in the backend of the application can be seen in the Functional Requirements Evaluation of Nutritional Facts Display (3.4), and Call and Fetch API Response (3.5).
	
	\section{Changes Due to Testing}
	\subsection{Changes Due to Functional Requirements Testing}
	Due to the failed test cases during functional requirements testing, Utrition's implementation will be improved in the following ways:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The ``Enter" key on a user's keyboard will submit the user's response rather than create a new line during text upload.
		\item Switching to a new upload section (Text Upload, Voice Upload, or Image Upload) will remove all inputs from the previous upload page. 
		\item The ``Voice Upload" section will not continue listening after the section has been clicked off of.
		\item The ``Reset" button will not push the user to the ``Text Upload" section when they are not on it.
		\item ``Your most eaten food" will be changed to ``Your most logged food".
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Changes Due to Usability Testing}
	Due to the feedback collected during usability testing, Utrition's implementation will undergo changes to provide the best user experience possible. Taking into consideration the time constraints and the most commonly discussed improvements, these changes will be implemented:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Add ``Get Started" button to home page to take user to input a food item
		\item Add units to nutritional data output
		\item Create error messages for cases where inputted food item is not identifiable 
		\item Group entries in food history table based on entries submitted together
		\item Add graph to display past food entry data
		\item Optional height and weight user inputs to calculate BMI and recommended calories per day 
	\end{itemize}		

	\section{Automated Testing}

	The following tests are classified as automated tests:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item one-upload-auto-1

	\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}
	
	The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members 
	on the
	graduate attribute of Reflection.  Please answer the following question:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan 
		different
		from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
		differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why 
		did
		these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in 
		future
		projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to 
		clearly
		predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build 
		the
		evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that 
		most
		teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
	\end{enumerate}
	There have been many changes from what was originally stated in the VnV plan. Most changes were due to project scope revisions (i.e. adding and removing requirements) or infeasibility of tests. After our POC demonstration, Utrition's scope was altered from only allowing a user to upload an image to also allowing text and voice upload. Due to this, our development team did not have tests planned for these new requirements as they had not been created at the time. The VnV plan has now been updated to test this functionality. Additionally, some tests that were previously created were removed because they were either no longer relevant with the altered scope or infeasible in terms of time/resources. Now that all team members have worked on a large project, identifying these time/resource constraints will make it easier for planning in future projects. Lastly, semi-structured interviews (usability testing) were added to provide unrestrained feedback from users regarding all aspects of Utrition's functionality and UI. Previously, our development team had not considered the possibility of user testing, but this was later pursued after all the feedback received during the POC and Revision 0 demonstrations proved to be helpful. It was not possible for Utrition's development team to anticipate the specific scope changes that occurred. However, we now know going forward to anticipate requirements changes (causing additions and deletions of tests) when user testing or demonstrations are conducted.
