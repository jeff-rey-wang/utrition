\section{Problem Statement}

\wss{You should check your problem statement with the
\href{https://github.com/smiths/capTemplate/blob/main/docs/Checklists/ProbState-Checklist.pdf}
{problem statement checklist}.}
\wss{You can change the section headings, as long as you include the required information.}

\subsection{Problem}
Malnutrition is an often overlooked health issue that is becoming more prevalent as time goes by. In fact, malnourished individuals may not know they are not consuming the proper amount of nutrients to keep them healthy. As a result, undernourished individuals will have a weaker immune system and stunted growth, while overnourished individuals will have cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. All of these factors lead to a lower life expectancy. There are nutrition apps that help the user track the progress to their nutritional goals, but all of them require the user to manually input each component used for their meal. Searching for each component can be overwhelming and tedious to some users. Therefore, some users end up never using their downloaded app even though they had an interest in taking care of their nutritional health.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Environment}
Utrition will be software that can be used on any device with a web browser. Utrition will be hosted locally as a webapp. 

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

This section contains project goals that are not integral to the development of Utrition, but would be valuable extensions to develop once the aforementioned goals are met.

\subsection{Web Hosting}

Users will be able to access the Utrition application online through a website hosted on the internet. This will increase the user base of Utrition by making Utrition more accessible and convenient to use. Once hosted online, the delay between passing an input to Utrition and receiving an output will be similar in length to the local implementation of Utrition within a small margin of error.

\subsection{Logging Preset Meals}

Users will be able to create presets of their commonly eaten meals on Utrition and save them for future use. Once a preset is created, a user will be able to select it to log the information of the meal without needing to manually re-upload images. This feature will allow users to customize Utrition to fit their eating habits, while also reducing the amount of time it takes to log a meal and access its information.

\subsection{Identifying Complex Food Items}

One stretch goal our team has is to improve upon the product's food identification implementation. Once our system is able to identify basic food items consisting of one part (ex. apple, cheese, chicken), the next step would be for Utrition to identify increasingly complex items and its individual parts (ex. hamburger with bun, beef, tomoato, lettuce, and cheese). This feature allows the user to simply input one image of their meal instead of uploading pictures of its individual parts. The result is a significant reduction in time needed for the user to determine their nutrition facts for their meal, increasing the efficiency and usability of the system.

\subsection{Providing Insights into User's Eating Habits}

Another stretch goal for Utrition is being able to provide insights into the eating habits of the user. For example, some insights the system might give include informing the user that their calorie count is too low or that they are deficient in fibre. With this additional functionality, the application becomes more informative and useful for users. Instead of simply tracking their food intake, users will now receive suggestions to improve their eating habits.
